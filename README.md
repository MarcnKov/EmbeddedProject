This repository contains the feasibility and design study for the digital processing subsystem (DPS) of a space instrument. The instrument consists of 50 linear sensors, each with 100 pixels, and a Front End Electronics (FEE) subsystem for analog-to-digital conversion and data transfer.

** Key Features: ** 

- Data Transfer: The DPS receives 16-bit pixel data from the FEE via a SpaceWire link using the RMAP protocol at 50 Mb/s.
- Acquisition Timing: External clock-driven acquisition every 100 ms, with 10 ms integration time per sensor.
- Design Study: This repository details the design considerations, architecture, and feasibility analysis of the DPS for efficient data handling and processing in the space environment.

This project is part of Phase A development of the space instrument.# EmbeddedProject
